# Done

- scripts `teaching/imitation/teaching_bc.py` and `teaching/imitation/teaching_dagger.py`

(reward from the novice way lower than reward from the expert)

# Todo

- Check the efficiency of the Conservative Sampling teacher in normal context 
and in BC context  
- `test_predict_one_step` not passing since new predict vectorized method
